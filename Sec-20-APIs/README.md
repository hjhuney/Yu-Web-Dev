# Sec 20: APIs

API is short for Application Programming Interface. An API is a set of commands, functions, protocols, and objects that programmers can use to create software or interact with an external system. It provides developers with standard commands for performing common operations so they do not have to write the code from scratch. 

For instance, iOS developers use an API provided by Apple to interact with the operating system. 

APIs are also used to interact with an external system. For instance, people who sign up for Tinder provide their Facebook log-in details. Tinder is able to go to Facebook's servers to see your friends and interact with parts of the Tinder app. 

If we want to make a dating app that matches people based on Facebook likes, we need to sent a GET request to Facebook's server from our server. Facebook's server will send a response back to our server. In order to do this, we have to use the API. 

### Bitcoin Average Website
