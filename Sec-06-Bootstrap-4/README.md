# Sec 6: Bootstrap 4

Bootstrap is a front-end library that is open-source and was originally developed at Twitter. 

Can use [codeply](https://www.codeply.com/) to experiment with Bootstrap. 

## Installing Bootstrap

Go to getbootstrap.com and copy the [CSS code](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/) in the head. CDN stands for "Content Delivery Network". Bootstrap hosts their files on Max CDN in many locations throughout the world, so the browser will look for the shortest route to download. Also most of your users will probably have Bootstrap file saved in their cookies since it's very common. 

You can also use Boostrap by coding their "[Starter Template](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/#starter-template)" code. You can also download Bootstrap source code. 

## Wireframing

Design the website before doing the tech; normally with pencil and paper. The opposite of wireframing is a "mock-up", which is a high-fidelity representation of website design. The good thing with mock-ups shows exactly how it wants to look. The problem with mock-ups is that they can bog you down with details.

Can also use [sneakpeekit](sneakpeekit.com) for templates to wireframe. 

Industry standard tool for wireframming is [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.cloud). You can share designs with others on Balsamiq. 

## The Bootstrap Navigation Bar

The < nav > tag is similar to < div >. It's generally used to indicate the navigation bar.
