# Sec 6: Bootstrap 4

Bootstrap is a front-end library that is open-source and was originally developed at Twitter. 

Can use [codeply](https://www.codeply.com/) to experiment with Bootstrap. 

## Installing Bootstrap

Go to getbootstrap.com and copy the [CSS code](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/) in the head. CDN stands for "Content Delivery Network". Bootstrap hosts their files on Max CDN in many locations throughout the world, so the browser will look for the shortest route to download. Also most of your users will probably have Bootstrap file saved in their cookies since it's very common. 

You can also use Boostrap by coding their "[Starter Template](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/#starter-template)" code. You can also download Bootstrap source code.
